                <p class="introParagraph"> I am Joey Bruno, or as it says above, Joseph Angelo Bruno, but it does not matter whether you call me Joey or Joseph. So, do what you want! I am currently living in the Nashville area. I graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in the summer of 2018 with a Communications degree. I have worked as a Social Media Coordinator for Rizzy Home in Calhoun, Georgia while living in Chattanooga after graduation. I am an avid coffee shop traveler throughout the surrounding areas of Nashville and go maybe four times in a week. Video games are quite a hobby of mine, essentially since I was a child.</p>
                
                <p>I was born in  New York and have been an avid New York Jets fan since. I have had many disappointing years during this fandom, but there are a few years that truly are remarkable. Such as the 2009 and 2010 seasons when the Jets were in the AFC Championship games. One other season, 2015, brought many joys in my life, but no playoffs. However, one fond memory I have that season was when the Jets beat the Patriots and I ran around with my family's former dog, Annie, around the living room. Now, they have had a top ten draft pick for the past few years. So it has been a fun ride of torment. </p>
                
                <p class="lastParagraph"> My favorite coffee shops are Frothy Monkey, Red Bicycle, Black Press in Gallatin and Hendersonville, a few in Chattanooga, and I am sure many others I cannot think of. My favorite games are Kingdom Hearts, God of War 2018, Marvel's Spider-Man, Ratchet & Clank, and many more.</p>
